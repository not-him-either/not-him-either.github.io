I met somebody
Selfless and kind
She’s got a smile even when she isn't fine
She can be hurting but she's got enough love to fill up Tennessee

I met somebody
Stays up at night
I see her worry and she sees all of mine
I met somebody she really loves me says I'm all she needs

And I
Grew up thinking I would have to
Fight all of this alone
But now you

Hold me in the darkness
Hold me ’till it hurts less
You, tell me that I'm alright
Show me where the light shines through

Please stay love me through the weather
Please say this’ll be forever
Hold me in the darkness
Even when it’s hard, with you

It’s a little bit, little bit better
I met somebody
Gentle and smart
He underestimates the size of his heart
He can be laughing but he’s got enough pain to fill up New York City

I met somebody
So full of scars
The worlds on his shoulders but he won’t fall apart
I met somebody he really loves me says I'm all he needs

And I
Grew up thinking I would have to
Fight all of this alone
But now you

Hold me in the darkness
Hold me ’till it hurts less
You, tell me that I'm alright
Show me where the light shines through
Please stay, love me through the weather
Please say this’ll be forever

Hold me in the darkness
Even when it’s hard, with you
It’s a little bit, little bit better

Oh-oh
It’s a little bit, little bit better
It’s a little bit, little bit better

And I
Grew up thinking I would have to
Fight all of this alone
But now you

Hold me in the darkness
Hold me ’till it hurts less
You, tell me that I'm alright
Show me where the light shines through

Please stay love me through the weather
Please say this will be forever
Hold me in the darkness
Even when it’s hard, with you
It’s a little bit, little bit bette
